<h1 style="color:white;text-align:center;">F R E E D O M ?</h1>
<p style="color:white;text-align:center;">Tasmania is the outcasted state of Australia and we won't stand for it any longer. We have had companies like Woolsworths and Coles be able to corner a market due to people not believing there is a market here. More and more we are pushed apart by a tide of rhetoric, without even being land tied. If a country like Estonia can force independence while next to countries, surely a sea surrounded island can. We don’t need Australians, or Australia; in fact “Mainlanders” have caused higher housing rates and prices to increase from tourism. I don’t hate tourism, but 5$ for a can is outrageous, and that’s just the beginning. </p>
<p style="color:white;text-align:center;">We barely need australia. We make enough from exports to support ourselves where Australia just takes our homes and causes people to not be able to afford homes. Why should a basic 3 bedroom house cost more than half a million? It’s a travesty, and it’s been caused partly by the mainlanders, with landlords taking advantage.</p>
